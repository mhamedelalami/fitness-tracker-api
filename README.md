## ‚úÖ Week 2
 Progress

This week, I focused on the **design phase** of the project:

- **Created the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** to visualize the database structure and relationships.  
  - Entities: **User**, **Activity**, **Activity Type**  
  - Relationships: One-to-Many between **User** and **Activity**, and between **Activity Type** and **Activity**.  
- **Defined the core API endpoints** to match the ERD and planned features.
